## Technologies

We discussed between making a desktop app or a web application. Tradeoffs included things like privacy, platform independence, ease of use, etc. After careful consideration we decided to make a web application, but without a database that is stored in the cloud. We realize that the privacy is the main aspect of our product: users do **not** want their data to be seen by anyone except themselves.

To make a web app, it is best to use JavaScript, so we decided to use *React* as our frontend framework to use. For the database, we will use Firebase.

## Organization

Daily meetings, retrospective, sprint planning, and sprint review are all planned and scheduled as follows:
- daily meetings at 7pm MSC every working day
- sprint planning on Monday in the mornings
- sprint review on Friday in the evenings
- sprint restrospect after each sprint review
